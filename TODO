* "working" spinner display for new project creation (actually a redirect to a 'waiting' page?)
* use a queue for handling document generation tasks

* rdoc generation validation (what if it doesn't generate for some reason?)
* translate markdown / textile READMEs

* index pages for individual project owners
* indicate if post-commit hook is installed
* docs for different branches / tags?
